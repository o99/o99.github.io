## Our Collection and Use of Anonymized Data

Org99 does not collect, store, or log any user data content that passes through our network. During required network maintenance and troubleshooting, network packets, including content, may be monitored to ensure successful network functionality.

Org99 may process network packet headers for traffic passing through the Org99 network for the following purposes:


* to troubleshoot and ensure successful network functionality
* to collect aggregate statistics for planning and dashboarding purposes
* to provide general anonymized reports about network operations to advance Org99’s non-profit mission.

Non-anonymized data is never stored or logged for any longer than necessary to process the data for a purpose listed above.

The Org99 network is unencrypted, easy to join, and depends on donated resources such as internet, telecom links, and other networking components from individuals and third-party entities which are beyond the control of Org99. Therefore, traffic which exits the Org99 network may be subject to external monitoring or recording at or beyond those network access points. 

## Voluntarily Submitted Data and Data Transmission

Org99 stores basic contact information voluntarily provided by members, which may include individuals’ names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails. This information may be shared with volunteers for the purpose of completing a requested install, network maintenance, or communications about Org99. Portions of the data may be de-identified and shared publicly as Org99 node locations. No identified information is shared with any third-party entities though it may be stored or processed on third-party systems such as online documents, email systems, and/or cloud-hosted systems.

## Sharing Data with Third Parties

Org99 does not partner with third parties to collect any data or information, nor do we have any data or information sharing agreements with third-party entities. 

Org99 will comply with all laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. However, because Org99 collects only the limited, aforementioned data, it is unable to provide non-anonymized, historical data to any entity that may request it.
